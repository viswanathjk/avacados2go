# Deriving and visualizing valuable insights

After gathering information from the business, designing a data warehouse, and creating an ETL pipeline for the Avacados2Go, we finally proceeded with the visualization and analytics i.e., reviewing the data model and relationships and then building reports and dashboards. The whole purpose of doing the same is to get a better picture of the entire process and demonstrate the final outcomes to businesses and those who require it for business purposes. 

We connected to our SQL Server Database and imported all the dimensions and fact tables to the Power BI. There is a wide range of methods for determining the variation in sales and the objective of the project is to create a sales forecast based on the historical data provided to us. We created graphs showing sale price by year and category, sales for the top three products, sale price by city, and sale price by year. The process of the creation of the dashboards has been documented along with the snapshots of each of the steps in the process. The tools used for this purpose were Microsoft Power BI and SSMS i.e., SQL Server Management Studio 18.

We then used the features of Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. We used the model view in the quick view panel to understand the relationship between the tables. And the data view provided us a view of the contents in the tables. And we created the dashboard using the report option in the quick view panel. We used the analytics option in the Power BI to forecast the sales for the future years using the historical data.
